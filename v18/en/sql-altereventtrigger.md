## ALTER EVENT TRIGGER

ALTER EVENT TRIGGER — change the definition of an event trigger

## Synopsis

```
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name DISABLE
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ]
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER name RENAME TO new_name
```

## Description

`ALTER EVENT TRIGGER` changes properties of an existing event trigger.

You must be superuser to alter an event trigger.

## Parameters

*`name`*: The name of an existing trigger to alter.

*`new_owner`*: The user name of the new owner of the event trigger.

*`new_name`*: The new name of the event trigger.

`DISABLE`/`ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ]`: These forms configure the firing of event triggers. A disabled trigger is still known to the system, but is not executed when its triggering event occurs. See also [session_replication_role](runtime-config-client.md#GUC-SESSION-REPLICATION-ROLE).

## Compatibility
